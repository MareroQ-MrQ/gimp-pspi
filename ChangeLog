	* configure.in: Bump version number to 1.0.1.

	* src/main.c: Store pspi settings in a separate pspirc file (in
	XML format...), not in the gimprc file.

	Don't rescan for Photoshop plug-ins after settings changed, it
	crashes the GIMP 1.2.3, sigh.

	Don't look for Photoshop's own Plug-ins directory. The
	Adobe-supplied plug-ins won't work anyway.

	* src/pspi.c: Too many changes to list. Some important bug fixes,
	for instance imageSize.h and v were swapped by mistake.

	* src/genproxies.m4: New parameter to the (already too
	complicated) PROXY macro: fmtvals, to enable printing call
	parameters through some pretty-printing function.

	* src/Makefile.am: Distribute piproxy.c. Don't use windres any
	longer to copy resources from target.8bf to piproxy.8bf. (Instead,
	the person debugging should use copy-resources.)

	* src/copy-resources.c: New file. For debugging, this program
	simply prints out the Windows resources found in an
	executable. Note that the output is not in correct resource source
	file format
	(.rc).

	* src/copy-resources.c: New file. This program copies the Windows
	resources from one executable to another (to be used to copy
	resources from the target plug-in to piproxy.8bf).

	* src/Makefile.am: Add new files.

	* autogen.sh: New file.

	* src/main.c
	* src/pspi.c: Add Help About functionality.

	Seems to work reasonably well now.

	* configure.in: Bump version number to 1.0.0.

2001-12-10  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* Started work on this.
