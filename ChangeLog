	* README: Update for Linux builds.

	* configure.in: Bump version to 1.0.4.

	* src/Makefile.am: Link explicitly with -lgdi32 for winegcc's
	sake. On Linux, install the pspi.exe.so, too.

	* src/main.c (my_ftw): Use S_IFDIR instead of _S_IFDIR. Also mingw has S_IFDIR.

	* src/pspi.c (g_win32_error_message)
	* src/dump-resources.c (g_win32_error_message)
	* src/copy-resources.c (g_win32_error_message): Include
	g_win32_error_message() from GLib when building on Linux.

	* src/pspi.c (display_pixels_proc): Don't display error message if
	BitBlt() fails but GetLastError() says there was no error
	(huh?). That seems to happen with Wine a lot.

2004-05-06  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* === Released 1.0.3 ===

	* src/Makefile.am: Uncomment the -mwindows, accidentally left
	commented out.

	* src/main.c (run_pspi): Don't display the slash in the progress
	bar.

2004-04-11  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* Lots of files: Modifications for GIMP 2.0 (after looking at
	gimp-plugin-template for inspiration). Bump version to 1.0.3. No
	real changes to functionality.
	
	* src/makefile.msvc: Remove, unmaintained.
	* src/Makefile.am: Don't distribute it.

2001-12-29  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* src/pspi.c: Lots of changes. Here are the most important: 

	Keep track of the Handles we have allocated ourselves. In the
	handle suite of functions, check if the Handle parameter is one of
	those. If not, it might be a Windows HGLOBAL handle, or a pointer
	to a HGLOBAL handle. If so, act accorgingly. Modify also the
	saving and restoring of filter.parameters accordingly.

	Some plug-ins pass HGLOBAL Windows handles to the handle
	functions... Presumably they can get away with this because
	Photoshop itself uses Windows HGLOBALs as Handles?
	
	Don't save and restore filter.parameters and data
	unnecessarily. They should be saved only after the
	filterSelectorParameters phase, and only need to be restored in
	the "re-apply last filter" case, where we invoke the
	filterSelectorPrepare phase right away. Use a global data
	variable.
	
	Don't call filterSelectorFinish at all. Some plug-ins crash there,
	and most plug-ins have done their useful job already in the
	filterSelectorStart and filterSelectorContinue phases. As pspi is
	a separate process that will terminate shortly afterwards anyway,
	there is no resource leak risk.

	* README: Update and improve.

	* configure.in: Bump version number to 1.0.2.

2001-12-28  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* src/main.c (init): Don't try to rename the pspirc file to
	pspirc.bak if it isn't there.

	* src/pspi.c (pspi_prepare): Remove leftover debugging output.

2001-12-28  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* src/pspi.c (pspi_prepare): 

	* configure.in: Bump version number to 1.0.1.

	* src/main.c: Store pspi settings in a separate pspirc file (in
	XML format...), not in the gimprc file.

	Don't rescan for Photoshop plug-ins after settings changed, it
	crashes the GIMP 1.2.3, sigh.

	Don't look for Photoshop's own Plug-ins directory. The
	Adobe-supplied plug-ins won't work anyway.

	* src/pspi.c: Too many changes to list. Some important bug fixes,
	for instance imageSize.h and v were swapped by mistake.

	* src/genproxies.m4: New parameter to the (already too
	complicated) PROXY macro: fmtvals, to enable printing call
	parameters through some pretty-printing function.

	* src/Makefile.am: Distribute piproxy.c. Don't use windres any
	longer to copy resources from target.8bf to piproxy.8bf. (Instead,
	the person debugging should use copy-resources.)

2001-12-27  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* src/copy-resources.c: New file. For debugging, this program
	simply prints out the Windows resources found in an
	executable. Note that the output is not in correct resource source
	file format
	(.rc).

	* src/copy-resources.c: New file. This program copies the Windows
	resources from one executable to another (to be used to copy
	resources from the target plug-in to piproxy.8bf).

	* src/Makefile.am: Add new files.
	
2001-12-26  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* autogen.sh: New file.

2001-12-22  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* src/main.c
	* src/pspi.c: Add Help About functionality.

2001-12-21  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	Seems to work reasonably well now.

	* configure.in: Bump version number to 1.0.0.

2001-12-10  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* Started work on this.
